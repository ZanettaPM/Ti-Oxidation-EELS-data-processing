# Ti Oxidation EELS Data Processing

This repository demonstrates the data processing applied to TEM EELS measurements of the titanium oxidation state in both standards and natural samples. It includes two demos:

TiO2 Standard: A single spectrum analysis.
Meteoritic Perovskite Grain: An example of data processing for a map, with one spectrum per pixel.

Instructions
To open and run the demos, use Jupyter Notebook and select the "TiO2.ipynb" file. Ensure you have the latest version of Hyperspy installed.
