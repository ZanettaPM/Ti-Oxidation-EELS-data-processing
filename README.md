# Ti Oxidation EELS data processing
 

Please find an exemple of the data processing that has been applied to TEM EELS measurement of the titanium oxidation state in both standards and natural sample.
The repository consist of two demos a) TiO2 standard with ultimately a single spectrum and b) An exemple of the data processing of a map has also been added on a meteoritic perovskite grain (one spectrum per pixel). 
Please find the related paper here: (https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2022-8311). Cite the authors if you are using it.
